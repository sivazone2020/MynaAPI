Currently, I specialize in helping students with Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) - 
including cutoff marks, college recommendations, and admission guidance.

For your specific query about other topics, I'm continuously being enhanced to provide 
more comprehensive educational guidance. 

Here's what I can help you with right now:
âœ… TNEA cutoff marks and college selection
âœ… Engineering college recommendations in Tamil Nadu  
âœ… Admission process guidance
âœ… Previous year trends and analysis

Is there anything related to Tamil Nadu engineering admissions I can help you with instead?"""
